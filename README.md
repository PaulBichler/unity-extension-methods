# Unity Extension Methods
My collection of useful extension methods for Unity classes. The goal of these extensions is to add functionality to
common Unity classes and to make code more readable.

## Installation
This package can be added to a Unity project through the [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) with the Git URL https://github.com/PaulBichler/unity-extension-methods.git.
